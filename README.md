ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Haydn or as my username says @iamhaydn.
Currently learing how to code frontend and backend web development through The Odin Project (TOP). I look forward to learning more and diving deeper 
into how every line of code comes together to make the world wide web.


- Goals:
- I hope to finish TOP by the fall of this year and learn tons of new coding principles and techniques.
- After finishing, I would like to take some time to do my own work to really fine tune my skills.
- Finally, I would like to possibly land a job somewhere to get even more experience.

To anyone that comes across this page somehow take a look at some of my projects and if you have some input on how to make things better please reach out 
to me through these social medias.
